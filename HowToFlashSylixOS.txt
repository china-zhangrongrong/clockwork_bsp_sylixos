1.Prepare a TF card,and format into FAT32.

2.Refer to the following steps to flash uboot in TF card
	a.Download u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin in uboot_for_sylixos
	b.Insert TF card in PC
	c.Use "demsg" command to show what device node was created,for example:/dev/sdb
	d.sudo dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdb bs=1024 seek=8
	
3.Copy bsp_clockwork.bin in TF card,bsp_clockwork.bin is the SylixOS kernel image.

4.Insert TF card in GameShell,connect the PC to the debug serial port on GameShellï¼Œ
power on and uboot will load SylixOS image for the FAT32 filesystem on TF card.

5.Use fdisk and mkfs partition and format TF cards under SylixOS.
Under SylixOS, the SD card is generally made into two partitions,FAT32 and Tpsfs.Tpsfs 
is a secure file system developed by ACOINFO.The FAT32 file system is used to store 
SylixOS images. The Tpsfs file system is used to store system and user files, such as 
system configuration files, user apps, library files, etc.
Refer to the following steps to partition and format TF cards under SylixOS:
	a.umount /media/sdcard0
	b.fdisk -f /dev/blk/sdcard-0
		2 4096 1 y 1 0 n 2
	c.remount /dev/blk/sdcard-0
	d.mkfs /media/sdcard0
	e.mkfs /media/sdcard1
	f.sync
	
6.Insert TF card in PC,copy bsp_clockwork.bin in TF card FAT32 filesystem again.

7.Insert TF card in GameShell and power on.
After the system reboot,if you see "[root@sylixos:/root]" it means that partition and format is ok.
You can use "showmount" to check if the partition was mounted success.For example:

[root@sylixos:/root]# showmount
AUTO-Mount point show >>
       VOLUME                    BLK NAME
-------------------- --------------------------------
/media/sdcard2       /dev/blk/sdcard-1:0             
/media/sdcard1       /dev/blk/sdcard-0:1             
/media/sdcard0       /dev/blk/sdcard-0:0             

MTD-Mount point show >>
       VOLUME                    BLK NAME
-------------------- --------------------------------

Mount point show >>
       VOLUME                    BLK NAME
-------------------- --------------------------------
[root@sylixos:/root]#
